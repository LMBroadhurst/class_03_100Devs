HTML Structure


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
    Stuff the browser needs
    </head>
    <body>
    Everything the user sees

Everything within the HTML tag is called the root tag

Head contains thing the browser needs but that we cannot see or interact with.
Body contains everything that can be seen or interacted with.
